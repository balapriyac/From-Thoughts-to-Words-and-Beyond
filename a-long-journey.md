Let us make it one step at a time<br>
The next few steps,<br>
We know not what lies ahead,<br>
Even with the sharpest of visions!<br>
Turn around gently,<br>
See the journey thus far;<br>
A phenomenal journey it has been!<br>
Distill from your experiences,<br>
The wisdom of several years!<br>
Guard it well, for it is your treasure trove!<br>
A few years hence,<br>
We’re oblivious to where we’d all be;<br>
Hoping to be at a better place, we’re all!<br>
Watch your next step, therefore,<br>
The distilled wisdom, your beacon;<br>
And your decisions mirroring your vision.<br>
For, even the longest of journeys,<br>
Has been traveled one step at a time;<br>
And every little step, does matter!
