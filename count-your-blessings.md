Itâ€™s all in the game of life, they say!<br>
A game that can often be tough and unfair!<br>
We all tread on our own solitary paths;<br>
Seemingly different paths, only by name though!<br>
Misfortunes greet all of us,<br>
Lined up in an infinitely long queue,<br>
Oh yeah! They never come single, do they?<br>
Efforts fail to bear fruit time and again!<br>
It all feels like an infinite loopâ€¦<br>
That we canâ€™t ever break out of!<br>
Why not switch gears,<br>
And look at life from a different perspective;<br>
And count our blessings instead?<br>
For very moment spent with our loved ones,<br>
Gifts a lifetime of happiness!<br>
Having a peaceful sleep on a silent night,<br>
And waking up the next morning,<br>
Thankful for yet another day!<br>
Arenâ€™t these the greatest of blessings themselves?<br>
Bestowed upon us infinitely many times!<br>
Finding happiness amidst waves of sorrow,<br>
Finding peace amidst the chaos,<br>
Finding hope amidst storms of despair,<br>
Welcoming every moment of life,<br>
As if it were a celebration!<br>
Is indeed an art that takes forever to master!<br>
The greatest of happiness, lies in the littlest of things!<br>
Live well, therefore,<br>
Starting this very day, this very moment,<br>
For this time, will not come ever again!<br>
Life is a celebration; not an ensemble of struggles and misfortunes!ðŸ˜Š<br>
