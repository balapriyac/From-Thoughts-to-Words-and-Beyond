With the Sun shining high,<br>
In the bluest of skies;<br>
The day is all bright!<br>
Thus passes the day,<br>
Moment by moment,<br>
Basking in daylight’s glory!<br>
<br>
Then comes dusk,<br>
Strutting in style,<br>
Spreading the dark hues all around;<br>
A thousand lights on;<br>
Countless lanterns in the air,<br>
Such is the illumination around!<br>
<br>
We see light on the outside,<br>
Apparent as it is;<br>
While silently battling the darkness within;<br>
Engulfed in dark clouds,<br>
Fogs of struggle and misfortune,<br>
Hindering visibility even to the nearest of things!<br>
<br>
Let not this transient fog,<br>
Deter your path to happiness!<br>
For, we are all here to live,<br>
And are entitled to happiness, each of us!<br>
Forget not to cherish it,<br>
For, it’s the most valuable possession of them all!<br>
<br>
