Those little moments of happiness<br>
Those cherished memories from the past<br>
Those joyous evenings<br>
The long-lost peaceful night’s sleep<br>
Did not last forever, did they?<br>
They’re gone forever, probably.<br>
<br>
Wading through those anxious minutes, hurt by denial<br>
For the smallest help that we needed the most<br>
When they all laughed at us, and celebrated our failure<br>
Those long nights of despair<br>
When we silently cried ourselves to sleep<br>
They didn’t last forever either, did they?<br>
<br>
As a gentle breeze of reminiscence<br>
Here’s our pleasant past, arriving in all its grace<br>
And as the strongest of storms<br>
Surfaces our past, tumultuous and painful<br>
Reliving the past we are, as we reminisce<br>
Is this forever, perhaps?<br>
