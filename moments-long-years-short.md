This seemingly innocuous trap <br>
When did I fly into it? <br>
I do not remember; <br>
Can I ever fly out? <br>
Nope, that’s far-fetched! <br>


Moments of agony stretch far <br>
As if time has stalled;<br>
Pangs of suffocation hit me hard,<br>
As if I’ve stopped breathing, I feel<br>
Waiting for the moment to transcend.<br>


Yet, in sufferings and pain,<br>
Umpteen moments have passed by,<br>
Moments unfolding to minutes, minutes to days,<br>
Days to weeks and months to years!<br>
A transition that’s elusive till this moment!<br>
**Perhaps, moments are long, and years are short?**<br>
