In abundance, we pour in
The most conscientious of efforts
Hurdles countless; nights sleepless,
Conquering our greatest fears
Persevering through tough times.
Welling up in eyes,
And trickling down the cheeks,
Are little tears of joy,
At the sight of success!
Yet, there’s in the tired eyes,
Lingering shadow of yearning
For a few words of kindness and praise.
Why chase the non-existent validation?
Embrace contentment and self-love rather!
Inspired by “You do not need the validation of others to know your worth! Self-worth comes from within!”
