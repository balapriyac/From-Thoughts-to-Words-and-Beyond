In abundance, we pour in <br>
The most conscientious of efforts<br>
Hurdles countless; nights sleepless,<br>
Conquering our greatest fears<br>
Persevering through tough times.<br>
Welling up in eyes,<br>
And trickling down the cheeks,<br>
Are little tears of joy,<br>
At the sight of success!<br>
Yet, there’s in the tired eyes,<br>
Lingering shadow of yearning<br>
For a few words of kindness and praise.<br>
Why chase the non-existent validation?<br>
Embrace contentment and self-love rather!<br>
