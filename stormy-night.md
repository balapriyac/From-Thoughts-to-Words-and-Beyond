Strong winds blowing incessantly<br>
Lightning bolts piercing their way through the windows,<br>
Bouts of thunder — loud and intermittent,<br>
Rains lashing against the windows, such was the storm!<br>
Her tiny blue eyes, now pale and wide, with fear,<br>
Ran the little girl as fast as she could,<br>
To her mother, and hugged her tight!<br>

<br>
Her mother, an epitome of affection,<br>
Took the girl in her loving arms.<br>
Nestling in the warmth of her mother’s robe;<br>
A few minutes hence, the little girl was asleep,<br>
Hours passed by, and the storm abated.<br>
A soft sheen now illuminated their eternal embrace,<br>
As moonlight shimmered through the translucent glass pane!<br>
<br>
