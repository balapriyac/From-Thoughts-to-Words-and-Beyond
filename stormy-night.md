Strong winds blowing incessantly
Lightning bolts piercing their way through the windows,
Bouts of thunder —loud and intermittent,
Rains lashing against the windows, such was the storm!
Her tiny blue eyes, now pale and wide, with fear,
Ran the little girl as fast as she could,
To her mother, and hugged her tight!


Her mother, an epitome of affection,
Took the girl in her loving arms.
Nestling in the warmth of her mother’s robe;
A few minutes hence, the little girl was asleep,
Hours passed by, and the storm abated.
A soft sheen now illuminated their eternal embrace,
As moonlight shimmered through the translucent glass pane!
