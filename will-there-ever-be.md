Will There Ever Be?

Will there ever be sunshine<br>
That expunges the darkness,<br>
Not of the world, but of the soul!<br>

Will there ever be a wind<br>
All so gentle and mystical,<br>
That sweeps away pain forever!<br>

Will there ever be a wave<br>
That waters the vast lands of despair,<br>
To let hope and goodness prosper!<br>

Dancing in joy, brimming with optimism,<br>
I hope to see myself thus!<br>
Will this day ever be?<br>

Warped by the unfairness of the world, I stand<br>
Wrapped in anxiety, nestling on low spirits,<br>
Will this always be?<br>
